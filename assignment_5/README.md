# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

python task_2.py

We use list comprehension to get the values in from 1 to 10.

The values are then printed.

Then we slice the first five elements in the list and print them.

Then we use list comprehension to reverse the list and print the reversed list.

Output:

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
